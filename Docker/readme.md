Docker

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers 
that have everything the software needs to run, including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications
into any environment and know your code will run.
